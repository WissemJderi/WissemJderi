# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Wissem

Self-taught developer building full-stack web apps. I care about writing clean code and making things that actually work.


**What I work with:**
React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Git, Linux. Learning Next.js and diving deeper into backend development - things like API design, database optimization, and server architecture. Picking up OOP with Java on the side to strengthen my fundamentals.


**Current focus:**
Working on a full-stack project from scratch - handling everything from database design to deployment.


**Looking for:**
Junior dev roles or freelance work. Open to contributing to real projects and solving actual problems.



**What I believe:**
Keep it simple. Build things that last.
